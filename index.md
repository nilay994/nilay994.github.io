A **researcher** employed by TU Delft, the Netherlands for making drones fly faster than ever.  

An **engineer** who can glue things together :) Not only with rivets and super-glue, also with crimped wires and voltages.
Far from "Give me a lever and I will move the world" but closer to "Give me an ARM processor and I will make the project work".
Linux user, can help you exit VIM. 

Nice to meet you! Nicer in person - D**3
