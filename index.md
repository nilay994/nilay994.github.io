An **engineer** at zepp.solutions, working with software for fuel cell systems and a zero-emission future. 

Previously a **researcher** employed by TU Delft, the Netherlands for making drones fly faster than ever.

I like bringing various sensors, actuators and processors together which (sometimes) leads to bringing the whiteboard idea to life ðŸ˜‡. 

Far from "Give me a lever long enough, and I will move the world" but closer to "Give me an ARM processor, and I will make the project work". Linux user, can help you exit VIM.

Nice to meet you. Nicer in person - D<sup>3</sup>
