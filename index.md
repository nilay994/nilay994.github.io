 <br /> <br /> <br />

A **researcher** employed by TU Delft, the Netherlands for making drones fly faster than ever.

An **engineer** spending time bringing various sensors, actuators, and processors together which (sometimes) leads to bringing the whiteboard idea to life :innocent:

Far from "Give me a lever long enough, and I will move the world" but closer to "Give me an ARM processor, and I will make the project work".
Linux user, can help you exit VIM.

Nice to meet you. Nicer in person - D<sup>3</sup>
