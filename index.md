An **engineer** with Fugro's innovation team, developing underwater robots for exploring underwater terrains, providing characterization for offshore energy projects and aiding marine biodiversity research.

Previously worked at zepp.solutions, writing software for hydrogen fuel-cell systems and a zero-emission future. Prior, worked with Lockheed Martin / TU Delft for making drones fly faster than ever. Also worked with Espressif Systems in Shanghai to write device drivers and firmware for their popular ESP32 chip.

I like bringing various sensors, actuators and processors together which (sometimes) leads to bringing the whiteboard idea to life ðŸ˜‡.

Far from "Give me a lever long enough, and I will move the world" but closer to "Give me an ARM processor, and I will make the project work". Linux user, can help you exit VIM.

Nice to meet you. Nicer in person - D<sup>3</sup>
