1. [The Artificial Intelligence behind the winning entry to the 2019 AI Robotic Racing Competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14985)

    Robotics is the next frontier in the progress of Artificial Intelligence (AI), as the real world in which robots operate represents an enormous, complex, continuous state space with inherent real-time requirements. One extreme challenge in robotics is currently formed by autonomous drone racing. Human drone racers can fly through complex tracks at speeds of up to 190 km/h. Achieving similar speeds with autonomous drones signifies tackling fundamental problems in AI under extreme restrictions in terms of resources. In this article, we present the winning solution of the first AI Robotic Racing (AIRR) Circuit, a competition consisting of four races in which all participating teams used the same drone, to which they had limited access. The core of our approach is inspired by how human pilots combine noisy observations of the race gates with their mental model of the drone's dynamics to achieve fast control. Our approach has a large focus on gate detection with an efficient deep neural segmentation network and active vision. Further, we make contributions to robust state estimation and risk-based control. This allowed us to reach speeds of ~9.2m/s in the last race, unrivaled by previous autonomous drone race competitions. Although our solution was the fastest and most robust, it still lost against one of the best human pilots, Gab707. The presented approach indicates a promising direction to close the gap with human drone pilots, forming an important step in bringing AI to the real world. A comment about the race was also later covered by [Nature Machine Intelligence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00405-z.epdf).

    Recently, drone races have gone fully-autonomous. As a result, these agile robotic platforms not only pose challenges of flying fast to the participating pilots but also create challenges for the flight control computers. As a result, the concept of autonomous drone racing has gained significant attention from research groups around the world. These races aim to push the boundaries of perception and control algorithms, while simultaneously mitigating the real-world uncertainty of execution on autonomous systems. While perception algorithms face challenges due to limited feature detection, high motion blur and computational requirements, control algorithms face challenges of convergence to the desired trajectories that are planned out in the race arena. This thesis addresses the challenge of control for racing, which is responsible for guiding the drone to design and track desired trajectories for fast flights.

3. [Li-Fi swarm robots with visual odometry](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-67934-1_18) - systems paper
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src="./img/publications/swarm-lifi.jpg" width="600px"><br><em>Project at SRA-VJTI</em></div>

    Motivated by the looming radio frequency spectrum crisis, this project aims at demonstrating that Visible Light Communication (VLC) has now reached a state where it can prove that it is a viable solution to this fundamental problem. VLC is a technique used for data transmission at very high speeds through light, which transfers data by varying its intensity at unperceivable rates. The proposed solution also establishes a closed loop with an overhead camera which mocks like a GPS in the swarm environment. Positional information of the robots is given by augmented reality tags and this data is fed-back to the robots via VLC. The paper elaborately describes the approach used to exploit off-the-shelf components for facilitating VLC. Overhead localization and the closed loop made here control each swarm robot with simplex communication. Problems faced while prototyping and overcoming them in revisions have been also described. 

4. [Motor driver using charge pumps](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7443724/)
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src="./img/publications/proteus.jpg" width="500px"><br><em>Project at SRA-VJTI</em></div>

    An efficient modeling of motor drivers using an H Bridge configuration driven by charge pumps controlled by embedded components is presented. N-channel MOSFETs and charge pumps together eliminate the problems of Dead time of MOSFETs and High values of RDS (ON). The embedded system using an ATMEL microcontroller drives the load and monitors the load voltages and input PWM to establish a closed loop system by comparing it with the stored threshold state space parameters of the motor, also in turn preventing MOSFET damage by synchronized control over the gates. Charge pump readings have been reported along with feedback readings for the microcontroller. Results obtained are in range with expected outputs.
