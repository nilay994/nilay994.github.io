### MAVLab, TU Delft's Aerospace faculty (2019-current)
Position: Researcher responsible for *Control, Embedded Systems, Path planning and State estimation*. 

AlphaPilot: Make drones fly at the limits of flight to finish a race in the shortest time, autonomously. Won **$1M** competiting against 400 research groups around the world. This challenge is introduced for staging AI against the top-most drone pilots of the world. The competition not only evaluates the competitive-ness of the deployed algorithms, but also gives researchers a chance to change the perspective of the pre-existing sport. This change of perspective towards a game took place earlier when DeepMind's AlphaGo beat the world champion Lee Sedol in 2016. Computers are capable of making decisions which are rather unanticipated by humans but in the end have a higher probability of winning. Such unconventional moves have led to a complete change of perspective in the 300 year old game of Go. AlphaPilot poses a slightly different technical challenge as compared to these game based AI algorithms by the introduction of real-world robot dynamics. While trying to increase the probability of winning, it must send tireless continuous millisecond signals which are not only responsible for making them fly the fastest, but also for fighting against pseudo forces, drag and gravity to maintain their stable "upside-up" configuration.
